                <h2>Outreach</h2>
                <p>As a FIRST robotics team, our main goal is to build robots. However, Bizarbots strives to go beyond the competitions and impact real change. We strive to encourage the youth in our community to become extraordinary adults, whether they decide to enter the field of STEM or not. Being involved in a robotics team requires diligence and patience, professionalism, and enthusiasm. These qualities are beneficial universally when students enter adulthood, and we want to instill these characteristics in every child who is interested in robotics.</p>
                <p>We have presented our VEX robots to students in our local lower elementary schools as well as during a seventh grade orientation at our high school. The reason we have such a large base of seventh graders is largely because of this demonstration.</p>
                <p>We have hosted a charity basketball tournament benefiting JDRF and we plan to do so again next year. We are also participating in our town's clean-up day, and are registered to participate in a local Relay For Life for the American Cancer Society.</p>
                <p>More recently, we've begun pursuing surrounding school districts around us about starting FTC and FLL teams. We hope to spread the positivity of FIRST to communities outside our own community soon.</p>
