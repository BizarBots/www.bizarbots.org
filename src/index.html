                    <p>The Bizarbots, Team 5494, is a robotics team founded in 2013 by science teacher and department head Richard Monteith and his son Kevin at Holbrook Junior Senior High School. Since then, the Bizarbots have competed in three Savage Soccer events and two seasons of the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC). Our team made waves in its rookie year in FRC, earning district awards such as Rookie Inspiration, Highest Seeded Rookie, and Rookie All-Star. Since the inception of the Bizarbots, our team has been involved with the local community through our STEM Summer Camp for elementary school aged children and various fundraising events.</p>
